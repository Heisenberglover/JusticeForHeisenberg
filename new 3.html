    <h2>What They Don’t Want You to Know</h2>
    <p>
        While the official story claims that Walter White died from wounds sustained during a shootout with a gang, the real cause lies deeper in betrayal, manipulation, and calculated execution by two of the world’s most infamous figures: The Bay Harbor Butcher and King LeBron.
    </p>
    <p>
        The conspiracy stretches far beyond what anyone could imagine. The pieces were carefully placed, manipulated by the unseen hands of those who wanted Walter gone — not just dead, but erased from the pages of history. They used his genius, his desperation, and his very humanity against him.

<section id="betrayal" class="section">
    <h2>The Betrayal</h2>
    <p>
        Walter’s life was a labyrinth of lies. What the world never knew was that his relationship with The Bay Harbor Butcher and King LeBron went back years before the infamous “Heisenberg” days. They were once allies — co-conspirators in a high-level criminal operation, one that stretched from Albuquerque to Miami, from underground drug deals to money laundering in the highest echelons.
    </p>
    <p>
        But greed and power have a way of altering alliances. The Butcher and LeBron grew tired of Walter’s unpredictability. They saw him as a pawn who was about to become more dangerous than they could control. The moment Walter’s cancer went into remission, they knew he was no longer their ally, but a liability.
    </p>
    <p>
        But Walter had his own plans. He was aware of the betrayal but didn’t know how far the treachery went. He began his own investigation, secretly gathering intel on LeBron and the Butcher. What he discovered shook him to his core — the extent of their manipulation, their plans, and their hidden connections.
    </p>

<section id="setup" class="section">
    <h2>The Setup</h2>
    <p>
        The Butcher and LeBron had planned this moment for years. They knew that Walter’s ego would blind him to the ultimate trap. They set him up with false leads, promising him a chance to take back control, to exact revenge on those who had wronged him. But in truth, they had already chosen the final location, a carefully crafted arena where the only outcome was Walter’s death.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Butcher, known for his meticulous planning, had prepared a series of false documents and fake promises of alliances. He used Walter’s own cunning against him, planting the idea that the real prize was just within reach. But the reality was a different story. The compound was rigged with surveillance and kill zones. Every room, every corridor, designed for Walter’s fall.
    </p>
    <p>
        Meanwhile, King LeBron used his vast network to ensure the timing was perfect. The police were nowhere to be found, the authorities too far behind to make a difference. Walter was cornered, not by gang members, but by the very people he thought he could trust.
    </p>
</section>

<section id="final" class="section">
    <h2>The Final Moments</h2>
    <p>
        The plan unfolded with precision. Walter was never meant to win. The bullet-ridden compound was only the backdrop to the real execution — an execution that happened in the shadows, hours before the firefight even began. The sedative was administered long before the first shot was fired. Walter never knew what hit him.
    </p>
    <p>
        His last moments weren’t spent battling enemies or clinging to life — they were spent in confusion, as the world watched the spectacle of the compound’s destruction. By the time he took his last breath, he was already gone.

    <h2>The Aftermath</h2>
    <p>
        The media spun their story, as always, and Walter White became just another casualty of the streets. But those of us who know the truth — we understand the depth of the deception. The Bay Harbor Butcher and King LeBron have moved on, leaving behind a trail of broken promises and lies.
    </p>
    <p>
        Yet, there is still hope. Walter’s research, his secrets, his final notes were never destroyed. Hidden in the vaults of an anonymous server, a flash drive containing the real story of what happened that day exists. Whoever finds it will know the truth, and perhaps, the world will finally understand the monstrous betrayal that ended the life of a man who once believed he could conquer it all.
